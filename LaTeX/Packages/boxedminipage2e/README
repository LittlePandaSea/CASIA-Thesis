Description
===========

The boxedminipage2e package is a very simple package that essentially
just wraps a minipage within an \fbox.  However, while
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}...\end{minipage}} juts out into the
margin, \begin{boxedminipage}...\end{boxedminipage} does not.
Instead, it subtracts the frame's dimensions from the specified
dimensions of the minipage before typesetting the minipage.


Installation
============

To install boxedminipage2e, run "latex boxedminipage2e.ins" to produce
boxedminipage2e.sty.  Move boxedminipage2e.sty into a directory
searched by LaTeX (e.g., .../texmf/tex/latex/boxedminipage2e/).
